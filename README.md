what is data?

the quantities, characters or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals or recorded on magnetic, optical or mechanical recording media

eg c = a + b


when data becomes information?

if data is arranged in a systematic way then it gets a structure and become meaningful
This meaningful processed data is called Information

what is a Data Structure?

a data structure is the systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently

eg arrays,


what is a Data Type?

two important things about data types:
	1. Defines a certain domain orf values
	2. Defines Operations allowed on those values

User Defined Data Types
-->In contrrast to primitive data types(int, float, char etc.), there is a concept of user defined data types.
-->The operations and values of user defined data types are not specified in the language itself burt is spercified by the user.

eg: Structure, Union and Enumeration

Abstract Data Types (Adt)
-->adt is like user defined data type which defines operations on values using functions without specifying what is there inside the function and how the operations are performed 

eg: Stack ADT



TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURES
-->Linear Data structures
-->Non Linear Data structures
