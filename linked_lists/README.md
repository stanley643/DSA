Ways to maintain a list in memory:
	1. arrays
	2. linked list

types of linked list:
	1. single linked list: navigation is forward only
	2. Doubly linked list: forward and backward navigation is possible
	3. circular linked list: last element is linked to the first element

linked list is made up of nodes
each node contains two parts:
	1. data
	2. link/address

array is a sequential representation of a list while linked list is not.
array list is stored concecatively in memory while listed list is strored radomly in memory
